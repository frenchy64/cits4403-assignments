  abstract={The author studies a forest-fire model introduced in a paper by Drossel and Schwabl (1992), by means of simulations with high statistics and very close to the critical point. In this way he can correct some statements made in that paper. In particular, he finds that the critical exponents are not the 'classical' ones proposed by Drossel and Schwabl. In spite of scaling laws with anomalous exponents, the typical states of the system are not 'critical' in the sense of being marginally stable locally.}
